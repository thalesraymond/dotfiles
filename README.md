## üöÄ Quick Setup

There are two ways to install these dotfiles: using **GNU Stow** (recommended) or by manually creating symbolic links.

### Using GNU Stow (Recommended)

GNU Stow is a symlink farm manager that makes it easy to manage your dotfiles.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thalesraymond/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
    cd ~/dotfiles
    ```

2.  **Back up or remove your existing configurations:**

    ```bash
    # Example for backing up Waybar configuration
    mv ~/.config/waybar ~/.config/waybar.bak
    ```

3.  **Use Stow to deploy the configurations:**

    ```bash
    # Deploy Waybar configuration
    stow --target=$HOME/.config waybar

    # Deploy Hyprland configuration
    stow --target=$HOME/.config hypr

    # Deploy all configurations
    stow --target=$HOME .
    ```

### Manual Installation

If you prefer not to use Stow, you can manually create symbolic links to the configuration files.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thalesraymond/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
    cd ~/dotfiles
    ```

2.  **Create symbolic links:**

    ```bash
    # Example for Waybar
    ln -s ~/dotfiles/waybar/config ~/.config/waybar

    # Example for Hyprland
    ln -s ~/dotfiles/hypr/config ~/.config/hypr
    ```
